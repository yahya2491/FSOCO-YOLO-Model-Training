# FSOCO-YOLO-Model-Training

# Description

This project focuses on training a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model using the FSOCO (Formula Student Object Detection) dataset. The goal is to develop an object detection model optimized for identifying objects relevant to Formula Student competitions.

# Features

  -Dataset preprocessing and augmentation

  -YOLO model configuration and training

  -Model evaluation and performance analysis

  -Exporting trained weights for deployment

# Future Improvements

  -Fine-tune the model with additional datasets

  -Optimize inference speed

  -Deploy the model for real-time object detection
